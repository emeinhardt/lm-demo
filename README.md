# lm-demo
A lab on language modeling with NLTK and a demo of some Jupyter/Python tools that can make presentation and data analysis easier.

# About the notebook files here
The 'local versions' here are for running on your machine. **NOTE that if you click on the .ipynb files here and look at github's rendering of them, you will see what only looks like a *very* incomplete portion of what's listed in the table of contents.** You want to **download** the notebooks to run them on your machine. 

# Another option - SageMathCloud
If you have trouble getting the local versions to work (and are willing to potentially trade one set of technical woes for another), you can take a look at the SageMath cloud version at https://is.gd/SOBuie. Unless you create a SageMath account, you won't be able to interact with the notebook (though you should be able to see a read-only version more correctly rendered than what's on github at the time of writing). Create an account, click on the previous link and take some inspiration from the (possibly slightly out of date) video tutorial at https://youtu.be/QcOK-LRCW38?t=1m6s.
